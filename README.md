# Master exercises

This is a repository to attach code-based exercises for the Master in Business Intelligence and Big Data, which I completed between 2025 and 2026.

A way to practice repository usage and coding requirements assigned during the programâ€™s evolution.
It also serves as a reference point to track my learning progress throughout the modules.
Additionally, it provides a space to revisit, optimize, and expand exercises into more complete projects in the future.
